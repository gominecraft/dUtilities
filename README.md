# dUtilities

Denizen script to give some baseline necessary features.

----

## Requirements

* [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) | [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/)
* [Denizen](https://ci.citizensnpcs.co/job/Denizen/) | [Denizen Development](https://ci.citizensnpcs.co/job/Denizen_Developmental/)

## Installation
... (of dUtilities, not the above requirements - that's your problem!)

* Download [dUtilities](https://gominecraft.com/files/dUtilities.zip)
* Unpack the contents directly into **plugins/**

If the server is already running, simply execute this in-game:

~~~
/ex reload scripts
~~~

Otherwise, start the server up.

That's it, you're done.

## Permissions:

**How do I interpret this?**

Each indent in the list is a child of the above.

Example:

dutilities.randomtp.other

* dutilities
  * spawn
  * setspawn
  * home
  * sethome
  * randomtp
    * other
  * clear
    * other

## Configuration

**Incomplete. This Denizen script is a WIP.**
